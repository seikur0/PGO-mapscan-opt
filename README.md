## Instructions
See [New User Guide (Windows)](https://github.com/seikur0/PGO-mapscan-opt/wiki/New-User-Guide-(Windows)) for a guide that is mainly windows focused.

We also have a [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/s2esz7Z).

## Recent Changes
* recent change from s to ms unit in learning files:
  * Use spawnfix.py to migrate your old learning files to the new format
* recent path changes:
  * Learning files go into the res/learning/learn_files folder, in the settings put the name of the file you want to use for a profile into the learn_file entry (without the .json). Log files are now in the res/logs folder
* recent scan pattern changes:
  * The r parameter is now the circular scan range in m around a point. If you want to use the old hex pattern, use the '-hx' and the '-r' parameter to specify a radius in hex layers
* PokeAlarm webhooks are now fully supported, make sure to set up a custom alarm text and use the \<respawn_text\> field to see messages like '15m later back for 15m.' for 2x15 spawn points for example

## Features
* uses hexagon algorithm for normal scanning
* after maximally one hour of normal scanning, it saves a spawnpoint file and starts intelligent scan (iscan)
* iscan = spawnpoints are scanned directly after spawn (no wasted scans and very efficient)
* perfect recognition and support for all spawn point types for both the logging and the map
* iscan uses much less workers
* multithreading
* long term stable
* perfect for data logging, has an autobackup function
* individual proxy possible for each id
* very good hosted map site, mobile optimized
* very low data usage (perfect for mobiles)
* pushbullet and telegram notifications
* many more small things that contribute to a smooth user experience

* Arguments are not required, but if used, they overwrite the settings in the 'usersettings.json' file, the standard id without arguments is 0, see [Command Line Arguments](https://github.com/seikur0/PGO-mapscan-opt/wiki/Command-Line-Arguments)

## Help wanted
If you have any learning files created with my tool, I'd like to have them, so I can collect them and create a larger database. So if possible I'd like you to send me these files per mail: seikur00@gmail.com I'll share them somewhere, maybe Google Drive, so everyone can access them. Thanks :)

## FAQ
* [FAQ](https://github.com/seikur0/PGO-mapscan-opt/wiki/FAQ)
  * I will collect questions, when I answer them the first time, and then I'll include a FAQ in the files here on github.
  * Don't think I'm impolite, when I'll just answer FAQ to something you write me. It's just that I want to do more with my day than answering the same questions over and over again :)
  * Suggestions and feedback in general are very welcome though, that helps me in finding bugs and improvements.

## Thanks

To Tejado, who made the original pokemongo api demo, which I based my project on: https://github.com/tejado/pgoapi

To the heroes of the unknown6 team.

To HEKTakun, I'm using his awesome pokemon icons for the map.

Check out the github page of lordbaconcake, it visualizes the beauty of the hexagon algorithm quite well.
And if you'd like to cover more complex or square areas rather than a circle-like pattern, check out his api.
